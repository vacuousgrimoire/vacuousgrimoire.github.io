# Zealot

Zealots are skillful adventurers driven by their fervent belief in a particular cause. Whether monster slayers, witchfinders, revolutionaries, or holy crusaders: zealots can accomplish remarkable feats through the power of that belief.

## Armour
A zealot can use leather armour, chainmail, and shields.

## Weapons
A zealot can use one-handed weapons and crossbows, and deals 1d8 damage with these weapons.

## Righteous Weapons
In the presence of undead, extraplanar beings, or powerful magic of an opposed alignment, a zealot's weapon glows with righteous light equivalent to a torch. A zealot's weapons can hit monsters that can normally only be harmed by silver.

At 4th level or higher, a zealot's weapons can hit monsters that can normally only be harmed by magic.

## Turn Undead
Zealots can invoke the power of their faith to repulse undead monsters. Roll 2d6 and consult the table below.

|Level|1|2|2*|3|4|5|6|7-9|
|-    |-|-|- |-|-|-|-|-  |
|1st  |7|9|11|—|—|—|—|—  |
|2|T|7|9|	11 	|— 	|— 	|— 	|—|
|3|T|T|7|	9 	|11 |— 	|— 	|—|
|4|D|T|T|	7 	|9 	|11 |— 	|—|
|5|D|D|T|	T 	|7 	|9 	|11 |—|
|6|D|D|D|	T 	|T 	|7 	|9 	|11|
|7|D|D|D|	D 	|T 	|T 	|7 	|9|
|8|D|D|D|	D 	|D 	|T 	|T 	|7|

If the turning attempt succeeds, the player must roll 2d6 to determine the number of HD affected (turned or destroyed).

### Turned undead
Flee from the zealot's presence if possible, and will not harm the zealot.

#### Destroyed undead (result of D)
Are utterly destroyed.

#### Excess
Excess rolled Hit Dice that are insufficient to affect another undead have no effect.

#### Minimum effect
A successful turn undead always affects at least one monster.
#### Mixed groups
In mixed groups of undead monsters, those with the lowest HD are affected first.
### Turning Table Results
#### —
The turning fails.

#### Number
If the 2d6 turning roll is higher or equal, the turning attempt succeeds.

#### T
The turning succeeds.

#### D
The turning succeeds; the monsters are destroyed, not simply caused to flee. 

## Lay on Hands
Once per day, a zealot can heal 2 hit points per level by laying their hands on wounded characters. Additionally, a zealot of 6th level or higher may cure disease once per week by laying on hands.

## Tracking
Zealots can identify and follow tracks. This skill improves as the character gains levels (see table below). 

| Level | Tracking |
| - | - |
| 1-2 | 2-in-6 |
| 3-4 | 3-in-6 |
| 5-6 | 4-in-6 |
| 7-9 | 5-in-6 |
| 10+ | 6-in-6 | 

Success may be modified by the following factors:

### Soft/hard ground
Increased by 1-in-6 or reduced by up to 3-in-6.

### Size of group being tracked
Increased by 1-in-6 per every three creatures.

### Passing through an area where other tracks mingle
Decreased by 3-in-6.

### Age of tracks
Reduced by 1-in-6 for every 24 hours.

### Rainfall
Reduced by 1-in-6 per hour.

### Efforts made to hide tracks
Reduced by 2-in-6.
