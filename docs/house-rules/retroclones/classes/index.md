# Classes

Presented here are drop-in replacements for the core classes in retroclones.

Most radically, the Thief is omitted (under the assumption that the Referee should allow any character to attempt "thief-like" actions via situational rulings).

The spellcasting classes have been collapsed to a single class, the [[Mystic]], who has mix-and-match spell lists to encourage specialization and support multiple distinct spellcasters in an adventure party.

The martial aspects of the Cleric have been delegated to the [[Zealot]], a "Van Helsing"-type character who tirelessly tracks foes and rallies allies with righteous light.

The [[Warlord]] is fundamentally an attempt to improve the Fighter, with a variety of additional rules to cleave multiple foes and perform martial maneuvers.

All these classes have been updated to use smoothed attack and saving throws progression tables, to provide more reliable rewards for attaining each level.
