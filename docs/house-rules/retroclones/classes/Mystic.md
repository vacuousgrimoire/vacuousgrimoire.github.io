## Spell list
The mystic, at 1st level, chooses two domains of magic from the following list. The two domains, together, make up the mystic's spell list. The mystic knows all spells on their spell list of each spell level they can prepare, as well as the spell *read magic*, which all mystics know.

### Domains
- [[Creation]]
- [[Death]]
- [[Destruction]]
- [[Dominion]]
- [[Force]]
- [[Knowledge]]
- [[Life]]
- [[Nature]]
- [[Protection]]
- [[Transmutation]]
- [[Trickery]]
- [[War]]

## Magic items 
Mystics are able to use magic scrolls of spells on their spell list. They can also use items that may only be used by either arcane or divine spell casters (e.g. magic wands, magic staves).
