# Injuries

As an adventurer, injuries are a fact of life. Whether being impaled by a spear trap, battered by falling rocks, or mauled by a griffon, for some injuries, mere hit point damage may not suffice.

## Guidelines

The Referee may adjudicate the application of injuries as a consequence of successful attacks or failed saves however they wish, but here are some possibilities:

- When a damage roll outcome is maximum, apply a minor injury.
- When a character takes a single instance of damage greater than three times their level, apply a minor injury.
- When a player is reduced to zero or less hit points and does not die (as in case of some house rules) , apply a major injury.
- Some monster's special attacks may cause a minor injury on a failed save. Very high-level monsters may cause major injuries.
- When a character fails a save vs. a trap, apply a minor injury. In case of extremely deadly traps, apply a major injury.
- If a character would receive an injury but is already injured, increase the severity of the new injury. Minor injuries become major, major injuries become permanent. Death is, of course, a real possibility as an adventurer.
