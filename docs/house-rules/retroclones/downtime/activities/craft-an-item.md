Making mundane items hardly ever comes up, excepting games where armor takes damage. It takes 1 day per 5 gold pieces of retail and they have to spend half the cost in raw materials. Complex items require the appropriate skill or background (e.g. characters must be a armorer to construct armor, a bowyer to create a bow, a cobbler to make shoes, et al.)
