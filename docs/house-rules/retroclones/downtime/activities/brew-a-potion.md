# Brew Potions

## Time
7+ days

## Cost
250+ gp

Clerics, magic-users, illusionists, and other spell-casting classes can brew potions. To brew a potion requires access to an arcane library worth five times the cost of the potion or the brewing costs are doubled.

Creating a potion requires the formula for the item. Characters can acquire a formula by breaking down an existing potion or by researching it following the processes in [[Creating Magical and Alchemical Items]].

Brewing a potion costs at least 250 gp and requires 7 days to brew and enchant. More powerful potions may cost much, much more.
