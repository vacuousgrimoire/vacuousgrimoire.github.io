# Suffer an Injury

The Referee may adjudicate the application of injuries as a consequence of successful attacks or failed saves however they wish, but here are some possible guidelines:

- When a damage roll outcome is maximum, apply a minor injury.
- When a character takes a single instance of damage greater than three times their level, apply a minor injury.
- When a player is reduced to zero or less hit points and does not die (as in case of some house rules) , apply a major injury.
- Some monster's special attacks may cause a minor injury on a failed save. Very high-level monsters may cause major injuries.
- When a character fails a save vs. a trap, apply a minor injury. In case of extremely deadly traps, apply a major injury.

# Recovery
Recovery from injuries is dependent on the severity of the injury.

## Minor Injuries
Recovering from a minor injury requires three days of rest or one use of *cure light wounds* or equivalent magical healing.

## Major Injuries
Recovering from a major injury requires three weeks of rest or one use of *cure serious wounds* or equivalent magical healing.

# Permanent Injury
Recovery from a permanent injury is typically impossible.

Treat a permanent head injury as a major head injury, which after recovery, results in an alignment and personality change.
