# Scribe a Scroll

## Time
7+ days

## Cost
200+ gp

Spell-casting classes can scribe scrolls, provided that they know and can cast the spell.

Scribing the scroll takes seven days per spell level and also requires 200 gp in materials per spell level. Crafted scrolls can only be used by the character who crafted them.

There is a minimum chance of 1-in-6 that scribing a scroll fails. If the research fails, the money, materials, and time invested are lost.
