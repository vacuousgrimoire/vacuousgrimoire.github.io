If a character wishes to build a closer relationship with a person, they can try to befriend them.

The player must decide on an approach to befriending the person. This is a reason for the person to improve their opinion. There are countless options such as gifts, personal accomplishments, mutual acquaintance, letters of introduction from notable persons, and more.

If the approach aligns well with the target's background and desires, success may be automatic, otherwise a reaction roll may be required. Circumstances such as poor approach, unfriendly dispositions, or bad reputation can modify the reaction roll by up to Â±3.  Success will progress the friendship one step. Repeated failures could reduce the level of the relationship.

Regardless of the success or failure, both characters learn a detail about each other according to their relationship level.
