# Celebrate a Venture

## Time
7 days

## Cost
Varies

Characters spend gold on drinking and socializing, telling the tales of their victory or drowning their sorrows over their latest trek.

First they spend gold per the following table and gain that much experience:

Settlement Size|Spent Gold
-|-
Village|1d4x100
Town|1d6x100
City|1d8x100
Metropolis|1d10x100

If characters lack the funds, they gain 1/2 the experience points indicated by the die roll and spend all their funds. The save has a penalty of -4 in this case.

At the end of the week, make a save versus death. Failure indicates a complication. Roll on the table below.
