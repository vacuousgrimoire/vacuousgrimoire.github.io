# Sacrifice to the Divine

## Time
1+ days

## Cost
Varies

The character can sacrifice gold, treasure, or even living things to petition for intercession from divine powers. The character must have a specific deity to make a sacrifice in service of.

The ritual can take the form of a desired cleric spell to manifest or the services of a celestial, demonic, undead, or dire creature for the length of 1 year and 1 day. The creature(s) can have one hit die for each 1,000 gp of sacrifce.

The miracle requires preparation of a day or more, depending on the scale of the miracle, per the table below.

The miracle requires sacrifice of 1,000 gp per level of the spell. The blood of each animal sacrificed reduces this cost by 100 gp, up to 500 gp. The blood of a sentient reduces the cost by 1,000 gp per hit die, up to a maximum of 10,000 gp.

Offerings contrary to their alignment or nature, (such as sacrifice of innocent sentients for many Lawful deities), will ensure the ritual's failure.
