-   Spells can be added to a spellbook by means of magical research. Researching a spell takes two weeks per spell level and 1,000 gp per spell level. Use of a scroll or a spellbook containing the spell as a material, reduces the time and cost by 50%, but causes the spell to be erased from the spellbook or scroll, whether or not the research succeeds.
- The cost of this research can be halved if the spellcaster has an arcane library worth 1,000 gp per spell level.
- There is a minimum probability of 1-in-6 that any magical research endeavor fails. If the research fails, the money, materials, and time invested are lost.
