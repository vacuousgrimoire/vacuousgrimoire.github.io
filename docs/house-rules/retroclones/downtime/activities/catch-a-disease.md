# Catch a Disease

1. Yellow Wound Rot: Wounds do not heal naturally but ulcerate quickly and cause a fever (no non-magical healing; -1 penalty to all rolls as long as there are lost hit points).

2. White Weep Skin: large patches all over the skin swell and turn sickly white (max hit points reduced by 1 per level).

3. Jointburn: all joints swell, ache and inflame (DEX bonus is reduce to -3, Initiative is halved).

4. Purple Stains: the skin at the sides of the neck, at the arm pits and at the loins becomes deep purple, like a hematoma ( -2 penalty on all Saves vs. Poison, and a -3 penalty on all Saves vs. Diseases).

All these diseases may be cured by a physician and 2d4 (minus CON bonus) days of rest, or by magic/super-science. Before they are cured, the attribute damage cannot be healed.
