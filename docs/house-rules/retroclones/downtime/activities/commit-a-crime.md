# Commit a Crime

If someone is caught for a crime, consider the judgment. The judge could be swayed to reduce the punishment by spending money on an attorney or a bribe. The character's Charisma also influences the punishment roll. However, strong evidence, previous criminal behavior, and character witnesses will provide penalties for the opposing sides. The Dungeon Master will set the total bonus considering all applicable factors. The crime roll is a reaction roll (2d6), and is modified by the following factors:
- -6 to +3 for evidence (1d10-7)
- +1 to +3 for bribes (10 gp, 100 gp, or 1,000 gp)
- There is a penalty of -1 for every previous crime committed
- The severity of the crime provides a penalty of -1 to -6
- For every board of influence the player controls, the roll is modified by +1 (q.v. p.177)
- Hiring legal representation provides a bonus of -1 (unskilled) to +3 (Master skill level); cost should be proportionate to the skill level
  
  Fantasy worlds can have drastic differences in morality. The Dungeon Master will have to design which categories of crime are minor, major, and severe. 
  
  Roll for the result.
