# Collect an Arcane Library

An arcane library is a collection of books, scrolls, and rare tomes as well as a laboratory with various alchemical and arcane equipment. It is used in creating magical and alchemical items and discovering new spells.

In order to possess an arcane library, 1,000 square feet of space is needed. A scribe must be hired full time to attend the library and keep it in good condition. If no scribe is hired, the library loses value over time as references are lost or destroyed.

Spellcasters attempting to [[discover-new-spell|discover new spells]] reduce their material costs by half if they have an arcane library of the required value from the table below:

| Spell Level | Required Value of Library |
| - | - |
| 1st | 1,000 gp |
| 2nd | 2,000 gp |
| 3rd | 4,000 gp |
| 4th | 8,000 gp |
| 5th | 16,000 gp |
