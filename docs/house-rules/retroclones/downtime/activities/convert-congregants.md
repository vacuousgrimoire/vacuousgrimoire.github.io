# Convert Congregants

## Time
7 days

## Cost
1,000+ gp

Characters who have a faith or religion can recruit congregants by performing charitable deeds, sending out missionaries, casting spells charitably on peasants, and constructing shrines and temples. For every 1,000 gold pieces spent a month doing these activities, make a reaction roll. The result indicates how many people join the character's congregation.

If a month passes and no action is taken to gain new followers and characters do not spend at least 1 week ministering to their current congregation, then they will lose 1d4 followers.

Why would characters acquire followers? Each follower provides support equal to their Hit Dice in gold pieces per month for any magical or construction activity the character engages in. This lowers the cost of crafting magic items, researching new spells, sacrificing to the divine, or creating constructs. It can also lower the cost of any construction projects characters take on in the interim, because the character's loyal followers work and donate their time without recompense.
