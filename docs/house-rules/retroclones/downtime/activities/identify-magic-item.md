If the character is not knowledgeable about magic, the time and expense is doubled.

Characters who wish to identify magic items must spend seven days and 100 gp in materials. The referee should roll a 4-in-6 chance of success secretly, as on a 6, the item is misidentified.

The time and cost of identifying potions or scrolls is halved, rounded down (i.e. three days and 50 gp).
