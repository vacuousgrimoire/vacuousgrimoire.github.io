Scouting an area requires at least seven days (more if the area is very distant) and 10 gp of supplies.

The scout provides a +1 bonus to saving throws for the party during the next adventure while the party remains in the scouted area. The scout has a 5-in-6 chance to learn of the presence and routine activities of one or more inhabitants of the area. If the inhabitants are particularly stealthy or the nature of the area hinders observation, this chance can be lower.

There is a 1-in-6 chance the scout has an encounter with an inhabitant of the area, but the scout cannot be surprised. The scout can evade as normal, or even more than once in some situations, provided they can make use of a different approach to escape, a diversion or ruse.
