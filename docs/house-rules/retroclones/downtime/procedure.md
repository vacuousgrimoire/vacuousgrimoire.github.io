# Downtime Procedure

## 1. Allot Days of Downtime
The party collectively decides on a number of days of downtime they wish to spend.

## 2. Select Downtime Activities
Each player selects a number of activities from the [[activity-list|activity list]] for which they meet the requirements, totalling time less than or equal to the allotted downtime.

## 3. Determine Player Order
Decide an order to resolve player's downtime activities. The easiest way is to resolve them in order of player readiness.

## 4. Resolve Downtime
Follow the following sub-steps in order for each player, in the order determined in step 3.

### a. Roll for Encounters
For every seven days of downtime allotted, the player makes a 2-in-6 encounter roll. Typically, the encounter happens in the settlement, but if some of the player's downtime activities occur elsewhere, the encounter may occur there.

Typically, the character is alone when the encounter occurs, but occasionally other party members may be involved depending on the circumstances.

### b. Pay Lifestyle Costs
Each player pays for their expenses. If unable to meet their debts, the character must borrow money or become a scofflaw.

#### Taxes
The player is taxed 10% of any new untaxed wealth. Any player who wishes to evade taxation can, but will become a scofflaw. They will need to lay low while in this settlement or risk punishment. This will likely limit their downtime activities.

#### Loding
The player must pay for their loding. If the player has a residence, you can use the table below for upkeep costs, otherwise consult an appropriate table in the rulebook for inn lodging costs.

| Structure | Daily Cost |
| - | - |
 | Cottage | 5 sp |
 | House | 1 gp |
 | Lodge | 5 gp |
 | Tower | 15 gp |
 | Keep | 25 gp |
 | Castle | 50 gp |
 | Palace | 100 gp |
 | Citadel | 250 gp |

#### Mercenary and Specialist Salaries
Record the date, the mercenaries, and the specialists you have hired. If their pay is due, pay them any back pay and for the next week at least.

### c. Resolve Activities
Current player resolves their downtime activities in any order, paying for each and following any procedures as appropriate. Players may opt not to resolve a given downtime activity for any reason, such as outcome of previous activities. If they do so, they do not spend any costs, but their time is wasted.

## 5. Repeat?
If so desired, the players may repeat this process from the beginning.
