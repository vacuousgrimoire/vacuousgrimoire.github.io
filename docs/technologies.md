## Obsidian
[[docs/index|Vacuous Grimoire]] is a [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault published as a website. This vault can be cloned directly from [https://github.com/vacuousgrimoire/vacuousgrimoire.github.io](https://github.com/vacuousgrimoire/vacuousgrimoire.github.io) for your own use.

## Mkdocs & Github Pages
[Mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) is used as a static site generator to publish this knowledge vault, using the magic of Jobin John's excellent [obsidian-publish-mkdocs](https://github.com/jobindjohn/obsidian-publish-mkdocs) template to deploy to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
