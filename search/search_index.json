In the morning of the 15th, as they broke camp on a chilly damp morning, they were greeted by another party of travellers. Jymes the hunter, and Tomumbulo the moss dwarf, descending to the lake shore with the goatman squire Hrannick Lankshorn.</p> <p>Hrannick explained in a rumbling voice that he is squire to Lady Bethmilda, and has been camping on a nearby ridge with the Brackenwold knights' horses. He urged the party to find Lady Bethmilda and companions, or at least retrieve their corpses, noting that they had not emerged from the grottoes for a week. He mentioned he planned to return to The Refuge of St. Keye with or without the knights on the morning of the 18th.</p> <p>Philimandrus was wary of the travellers, but they exchanged stories. The newly reinforced Mongooses descended into the grottoes, retracing their steps to the room where they met the doppelganger. They discovered the door to the north (beyond which they previously met giant frogs), shut by them, had been opened since last they came. In the darkness beyond, Tomumbulo's unwashed ears could clearly hear wet lip smacking and chewing noises, along with muted coos of delight.</p> <p>Jymes closed the door promptly, and then began carefully inspecting the room for tracks. He found a few distinct sets of tracks:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Three recent pairs of heavy human boot prints headed from the south entrance toward the doors to the corridor of giant frogs, and several slime trails following shortly after</p> </li> <li> <p>Below those, a set of small human footprints coming up the stairs to the east before become hopelessly covered by the footprints of the party on their last expedition</p> </li> </ul> <p>The Mongooses decided to head down to the lower level, following what they presumed to be the doppelganger's footprints. As they headed to the stairs, they caught a glimpse at the end of the corridor of the a huge wriggling cutworm-like insect, depositing eggs in the corpse of a giant rat. They quickly covered Philimandrus' bullseye lantern, and the horror seemed none the wiser, so they crept down the stairs quietly.</p> <p>On the lower level, they found themselves in a stone corridor lined with doors, which they searched. A collapsed room yielded only an overturned sarcophagus with a partially crushed human skeleton, but the next room's sarcophagus was still sealed. Tomumbulo pried it open with his crowbar, revealing a mummified corpse, bandaged and wearing a silver crown adorned with quartz stones.</p> <p>The corpses' eyes shot open, and its withered hand sought Tomumbulo's throat, but was bashed aside by the doughty dwarf's shield. Philimandrus cast a spell to blind the undead, while Rodger and Brom sought to turn it, but its will proved greater than their faith. As the corpse stumbled about blind, the party stabbed, slashed, and pummeled the creature, only for to rise once again. Rodger's mighty blow with the blade of Sir Chyde dispatched the creature for good, and he claimed the crown it wore.</p> <p>Another door held a short, rubble-filled stone passage, beyond which lay an underground lake. The party moved on.</p> <p>Rodger's mighty thews made short work of the next stuck door, revealing a room with a metal grate for a floor and an acrid stench. Ewe's Milk Esther tested the floor with a ten foot pole, not discovering any pressure plates or tripwires. Philimandrus stepped into the room, only for his weight to overmatch the counterweight, causing the metal grille to fall ten feet into the searing acid below.</p> <p>Miraculously, the illusionist avoided being too badly burned in his initial immersion, and was able to grab hold of the ten foot pole, while the remaining party pulled him up. Jymes and Brom dragged Philimandrus to the lake, quickly checking for danger before washing the illusionist clean of acid.</p> <p>The Mongooses were startled by a trio of phantoms sweeping past them from behind, floating over the lake's broken bridge to the island beyond and the three stone coffins that lay there before fading away.</p> <p>The Mongooses retreated to rest in one of the tombs, and Tomumbulo and Philimandrus discussed why the Mongooses were exploring the grottoes, as well as their future plan to seek the lost Harrowmoor child at the ruined abbey of St. Clewyd.</p> <p>The pried open two last coffins, using a simple ruse to send away the mindless zombie servants who lurked in the latter tomb.

Some further time was spent examining the rails upon which the grille floor rested, and speculating about its mechanism. Jymes collected some rubble from the collapsed tomb and began throwing chunks of stone stile onto the metal grille until the trap was re-triggered. The grille floor plunged into the acid once more, never again to raise.</p> <p>After some consideration, the Mongooses opted to retrace their steps to the opposite side of the acid bath room, hoping for a new perspective and suspecting treasure might be concealed therein. As they traveled back, they noted the absence of the egg-laying horror they spotted earlier, and opted to spend some time purging the giant rat carcass of its infestation of giant insect eggs.</p> <p>The Mongooses descended to the lower level again. Passing the burial urns, this time there was no sign of slugbabies, and they proceeded beyond to the edge of the pool of acid. From the pool of acid rose a stone pillar covered in candle sconces, and beyond that on the far side, a hallway and alcoves looking much like the one the party currently occupied.</p> <p>Philimandrus cast quasimorph, transforming into a giant centipede. Jymes tied one end of a fifty foot rope around his segmented body, and Philimandrus crawled up the wall, across the ceiling, down the pillar and around it once, ensuring the rope was secured well by the candle sconces, then back up to the ceiling and cross, finally descending back to the opposite hall and transforming back into himself.</p> <p>He began inspecting the alcoves on the wall, observing that each held a grotesque face with a gaping mouth. Finnegan took this time to transform into her chester form and dart nimbly across the taut rope, easily joining the illusionist before transforming back.</p> <p>Finnegan inspected the grotesques more closely, observing a rotating mechanism in the mouth and small holes in the eyes, while Philimandrus, moving aside to make room for his companion, noticed that the alcove at the far end of the short hall contained not a grotesque but a small square stone door at chest height with a keyhole.</p> <p>Finnegan attempted to pick the lock with her claw, but ultimately resorted to sledgehammering the door down when that did not work as planned. Beyond the door, lay a small cubic space containing dozens of stacked oversized coins, a hand mirror, a scroll case, and a small pouch. As the stone settled, Philimandrus heard the whirring of mechanisms from the six grotesque faces before their eyes began billowing thick plumes of choking noxious gas.</p> <p>Finnegan seized the scrollcase and hand mirror in one paw, throwing the pouch to Philimandrus, who fumbled it, before both adventurers threw themselves hastily at the rope before the poison gas filled the hall. They missed.</p> <p>The grimalkin and the illusionist, immersed in corrosive acid, scrambled to the pillar and clambered up, using the candle scones as hand and foot holds. After another perilous rope crossing, they rejoined the party and Finnegan mourned her formerly glorious fur.</p> <p>Inspecting the items they retrieved:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Extracted from the dissolving scroll case, Finnegan found two scrolls, one arcane and one divine, handed to Philimandrus and Rodger for safe keeping, respectively.</p> </li> <li> <p>The ebony hand mirror showed Finnegan the face of an unpleasant memory from her past, further upsetting the temperamental grimalkin.</p> </li> </ul> <p>After another discussion, Finnegan and Tomumbulo opted to make another trek across the ropes to retrieve the remaining treasure, Finnegan in chester form, Tomumbulo balancing with a ten foot pole. Tomumbulo made a misstep and fell, but caught himself using the ten foot pole. On the far side, they found:</p> <ul> <li>Four dozen oversized electrum coins</li> <li>The fallen pouch of five lead sling bullets marked with an evil eye</li> </ul> <p>On the way back, unfortunately, Tomumbulo slipped again and plunged into the pool below, acid scouring the moss dwarf's mostly nude body. Swimming back to the ledge by the party, he proferred the ten foot pole, which the party used to drag him from the acid, only slightly the worse for wear.</p> <p>The party rested and discussed their options, before returning to the upper floor and entering the southernmost crystal grotto with the keening crystals. When Jymes entered the room, the crystals spoke, \"Bow before the Faceless Lord\", and he kindly obliged.</p> <p>Venturing further into the purple moss covered grotto, they peered past the fallen stone door into the hallway beyond. In the darkness beyond were five doors, one ajar. Also, barely noticeable in the darkness were two translucent four-foot slugs crawling along the ceiling toward the party.</p> <p>The party fell back, firing arrows and slings at the slugs, and Philimandrus prepared a flaming oil flask to throw. Rodger stepped up to the doorway and slew both slugs with two mighty swings of Sir Chyde's magic sword.</p> <p>As the party caught their breath, they were disturbed by the appearance of a dozen scrabies with heavy packs. They spent some time bartering with the scrabies for their strange goods.
